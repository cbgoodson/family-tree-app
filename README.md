# Family Tree App

A minimal Node.js application for recording family members and parent-child relationships. The backend is a simple HTTP server with JSON persistence, while the frontend offers basic forms and a tree view.

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
3. Add people and relations using the forms and see the tree update instantly.

## Testing

The project uses Node's built-in test runner.

```
npm test
```
